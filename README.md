AVL is Binary Search Tree with Balance Factor -1,0 or 1.

Balance Factor of a node = height of left - height of right

Solution: Rotation to balance tree

Types of Rotation: RR, LL, LR, RL

RR: Single Anticlockwise Rotation

LL: Single Clockwise Rotation

RL: Two Rotations. First convert to RR. Anticlockwise Rotation

LR: Two Rotation. First convert to LL. Clockwise Rotation
